# inventory_management_tool
This project is an inventory manament tool which helps warehouse and inventory owners manage their stocks.
Here I have created tool using Python GUI which takes the user input about the warehouse/inventory stock and stores it in MySQL server.
There are 3 python files.
First one is main.py which gives details about the stocked item - its product ID, pricing, discount, quantity.
Second one is add_to_db file which helps in addition of new data into the database if a new product is introduced.
Lastly, an update.py script which opens up GUI where the user can update product details - its pricing, quantity, discount.
